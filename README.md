# Rust Exercises

Welcome to my Rust exercises repository! Here, you'll find various Rust programming exercises and solutions that I've worked on.

## Problem Statement

**Problem 1:**
Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.

**Problem 2:**
Create a command line tool named grep "globally search a regular expression and print" and use the concepts of Rust like strings, lifetimes, borrow, ownership, vectors and external library to complete it.

**Problem 3:**
The program that efficiently calculates the nth Fibonacci number using both a simple recursive approach and dynamic programming with memoization, showcasing the performance contrast between the two methods for any given input n.

**Problem 4:**
Given a set of stairs and a frog positioned at the bottom step (0th), the frog aims to ascend to the top step (\((N-1)\)th) of the staircase. The frog can climb either one or two steps at a time. Additionally, a height array of length \(N\) is provided, denoting the height of each step. How many distinct ways can the frog ascend from one step to another, considering the height array?

**Problem 5:**
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

## Getting Started

To get started with these exercises, clone this repository to your local machine and explore the source code. Each exercise is contained within its own directory and may include additional instructions or README files.
