# Rust Exercises

Welcome to my Rust exercises repository! Here, you'll find various Rust programming exercises and solutions that I've worked on.

## Problem Statement

**Problem 1:**
Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.

**Problem 2:**
Create a command line tool named grep "globally search a regular expression and print" and use the concepts of Rust like strings, lifetimes, borrow, ownership, vectors and external library to complete it.

**Problem 3:**
The program that efficiently calculates the nth Fibonacci number using both a simple recursive approach and dynamic programming with memoization, showcasing the performance contrast between the two methods for any given input n.

**Problem 4:**
Given a set of stairs and a frog positioned at the bottom step (0th), the frog aims to ascend to the top step (\((N-1)\)th) of the staircase. The frog can climb either one or two steps at a time. Additionally, a height array of length \(N\) is provided, denoting the height of each step. How many distinct ways can the frog ascend from one step to another, considering the height array?
